## Before Applying
Create a visually appealing resume and LinkedIn.
    - Ensure that your resume looks good, not just the content.
    - Use platforms such as LaTeX to make it visually appealing.
    - Optimize your LinkedIn profile with a professional photo, background, and detailed descriptions.
    
## Online Listings 
Don't apply to hundreds of jobs.

1. Use LinkedIn to contact people.
    - Focus on building your network if it's currently small or limited. Increase LinkedIn connections by adding people from various groups to reach 500+ connections.
    - When searching for roles, start with all of your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want.
    - Search for the company you're interested in and look for people in Engineering or with similar backgrounds.
    - Add filters to narrow your search to your alma mater, relevant majors, or even specific connections.
    - Send connection requests and messages to 1-3 people who clear the filters.
    - Keep your message simple and straightforward, and ask for a referral.

2. Wait for a referral before applying.
    - If someone agrees to refer you, let them apply for you.
    - Applying before you are referred may disqualify you.

LPT: Want to be the first to apply to new LinkedIn job listings? Here's how:

    LinkedIn gives you the opportunity to filter jobs posted within the last 24 hours through the dropdown menu, but what if you want listings that have been posted within the last hour or less? You can actually customize that with the url parameters. For example, here is the standard 24-hour filtered url:

    https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3433084183&distance=25&f_TPR=r86400&geoId=103644278&keywords=frontend%20developer

    Well, if you notice in the url, you'll see &f_TPR=r86400. Uncoincidentally, there are 86,400 seconds in a day. So, you can alter that value to whatever you want in seconds. For instance, one hour would be 3600, and so on.

    Good luck and happy job hunting!

    Helps with filtering out stale jobs.

    In my experience, donâ€™t bother applying to anything over 1 week old. 1/1000 chance they will EVER respond.



### For online listings, follow a strategy like this:

1. Apply to up to 3 to 5 companies per day.

    Don't just choose companies that are household names. Do a search for the skill or language that you want to work with the most, and look for any company that has bullet points that you at least meet halfway on.

    Ignore the Years of Experience line--as long as the job title doesn't say the word "Senior" in it, you're qualified enough to apply.

2. Once you submit your application, look up the contact info for the people that work there. This can be done via RocketReach, LinkedIn Premium, or hunter.io.

3. Look for either an internal recruiter who's on the payroll or an engineering manager. (If it's an early stage startup w/o recruiters or managers yet, then look for the CTO or lead developer)

4. Send them a direct Outreach Message via their work email. (A message via LinkedIn could work, but unless they're definitely a recruiter, there's no guarantee that the person actively checks their messages here).

    Just make it a short pitch on what you're applying for, and why you feel you'd be a good fit. (For bonus points: Look up the company on Hacker News and TechCrunch, or see if they have an engineering blog. Tailor your fit message based on the company's latest engineering efforts).

    Make this outreach message as personable and non-generic as possible. People gloss over the clearly copy-and-paste ones.

5. If you get no response after 3 days, send a follow-up message.

    I've found that you typically get more bites from the follow-up message than the original one. We're emailing busy people, after all.

6. If you get no response for 3 days after that, then send one final follow-up message.

## Local Companies 
Besides the online listings, you should be thinking about local companies, too. The biggest challenge here is that local companies who are willing to hire juniors/interns won't necessarily advertise that fact.

Hence, you need to be proactive about reaching out to them.

1. Do a search in your area for medium to large companies who most certainly should have a local software developer on staff. (Meaning, that's it's a company's main office. Every company needs a software developer these days, but they're less likely to be located at a branch location, unless there's evidence there that says otherwise).

    The company might even have a listing for an obscure position posted somewhere, something like Senior ColdFusion Engineer Wanted on Indeed.com or something dumb like that. Ignore this listing, but add this company to your list.

2. Do a search for "Wordpress freelancers" in your area. Many of these freelancers will actually be part of a local agency, and these agencies are typically open to hiring eager newcomers. (Obviously, you'll need to do some WP tutorials beforehand if you land an interview here).

3. Reach out to your local Chamber of Commerce. Every county in the U.S., U.K., and Canada that have people living in it will have

### Resume Guide
- Avoid generic resume templates like Indeed's; make your resume unique.
- Keep your resume to one page, especially with less than 5 years or 20+ years of experience.
- Use an appropriate font size, not excessively small to fit everything on one page.
- List technologies, specific projects, jobs, and relevant coursework.
- Proofread for spelling mistakes and errors.
- Include a link to your GitHub or portfolio for extra information.
- Use a professional email address (Gmail, Outlook, or personal domain); avoid Hotmail.
- Omit objective or summary sections to save space.
- Include only "City, State" for your address.
- Name resume file as "FirstName LastName Resume".
- Email resume as a PDF, or Word doc for parsing software if needed.
- Aim for 10-second readability to make a quick impression.
- Include interests to create personal connections and stand out.
- Include numbers on as many bullet points as possible. E.g. "responsible for managing team and hosting meetings" vs. "managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"
- Bullet point format: past tense verb (created, developed, etc), number, result number.
- Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the "vague description" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this and the resume will never get looked at.
- Use an inverted pyramid style: chronological order, descending number of bullet points e.g. most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order.
- Write a strong company description under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just what that company does, if it isn't obvious.This is *KEY!*Ex: "Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America." See how much better that is than just the name?
- Spell out numbers below ten; use "+" for rounded numbers and abbreviations for thousands and millions. (ex: "157 employees ---> "150+ employees") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital "K" for thousand, "M" for million (ex: $23,800 ----> $23K+; $5 million ---> $5M)
- Limit executive summary to two sentences with numbers and strong impact.
