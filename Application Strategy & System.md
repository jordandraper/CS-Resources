## Application Help

## Online Listings 
Don't apply to hundreds of jobs.

There's a reason why you always see people on r/CSCQ come and say that they're applying to hundreds of places at once. It's because the strategy isn't working for them, hence why they're showing up here. The people who follow a strategy that actually works don't come here.

But because these "hundreds-folks" will get a single bite eventually, they become convinced that the strategy does work. It's like a lottery player that wins $4 on a Powerball ticket, and decides to buy more Powerball tickets in the future because of it.

### For online listings, follow a strategy like this:

1. Apply to up to 3 to 5 companies per day.

    Don't just choose companies that are household names. Do a search for the skill or language that you want to work with the most, and look for any company that has bullet points that you at least meet halfway on.

    Ignore the Years of Experience line--as long as the job title doesn't say the word "Senior" in it, you're qualified enough to apply.

2. Once you submit your application, look up the contact info for the people that work there. This can be done via RocketReach or LinkedIn Premium.

3. Look for either an internal recruiter who's on the payroll or an engineering manager. (If it's an early stage startup w/o recruiters or managers yet, then look for the CTO or lead developer)

4. Send them a direct Outreach Message via their work email. (A message via LinkedIn could work, but unless they're definitely a recruiter, there's no guarantee that the person actively checks their messages here).

    Just make it a short pitch on what you're applying for, and why you feel you'd be a good fit. (For bonus points: Look up the company on Hacker News and TechCrunch, or see if they have an engineering blog. Tailor your fit message based on the company's latest engineering efforts).

    Make this outreach message as personable and non-generic as possible. People gloss over the clearly copy-and-paste ones.

5. If you get no response after 3 days, send a follow-up message.

    I've found that you typically get more bites from the follow-up message than the original one. We're emailing busy people, after all.

6. If you get no response for 3 days after that, then send one final follow-up message.

## Local Companies 
Besides the online listings, you should be thinking about local companies, too. The biggest challenge here is that local companies who are willing to hire juniors/interns won't necessarily advertise that fact.

Hence, you need to be proactive about reaching out to them.

1. Do a search in your area for medium to large companies who most certainly should have a local software developer on staff. (Meaning, that's it's a company's main office. Every company needs a software developer these days, but they're less likely to be located at a branch location, unless there's evidence there that says otherwise).

    The company might even have a listing for an obscure position posted somewhere, something like Senior ColdFusion Engineer Wanted on Indeed.com or something dumb like that. Ignore this listing, but add this company to your list.

2. Do a search for "Wordpress freelancers" in your area. Many of these freelancers will actually be part of a local agency, and these agencies are typically open to hiring eager newcomers. (Obviously, you'll need to do some WP tutorials beforehand if you land an interview here).

3. Reach out to your local Chamber of Commerce. Every county in the U.S., U.K., and Canada that have people living in it will have
