## Application Help
### Referrals Are Everything!
1. Create a visually appealing resume and LinkedIn.
    - Ensure that your resume looks good, not just the content.
    - Use platforms such as LaTeX to make it visually appealing.
    - Optimize your LinkedIn profile with a professional photo, background, and detailed descriptions.

2. Use LinkedIn to contact people.
    - Focus on building your network if it's currently small or limited. Increase LinkedIn connections by adding people from various groups (e.g., realtor groups) to reach 500+ connections.
    - When searching for roles, start with all of your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want.
    - Search for the company you're interested in and look for people in Engineering or with similar backgrounds.
    - Add filters to narrow your search to your alma mater, relevant majors, or even specific connections.
    - Send connection requests and messages to 1-3 people who clear the filters.
    - Keep your message simple and straightforward, and ask for a referral.

3. Wait for a referral before applying.
    - If someone agrees to refer you, let them apply for you.
    - Applying before you are referred may disqualify you.

4. Contact recruiters if possible.
    - Recruiters can be an excellent resource for finding job opportunities.

5. Be patient.
    - This method may not work for small startups.
    - This method is more effective for full-time jobs than internships.

6. If LinkedIn isn't working
    - Use hunter.io to find work emails of recruiters or other professionals to send cold emails.
### Resume Guide
- Avoid generic resume templates like Indeed's; make your resume unique.
- Keep your resume to one page, especially with less than 5 years or 20+ years of experience.
- Use an appropriate font size, not excessively small to fit everything on one page.
- List technologies, specific projects, jobs, and relevant coursework.
- Proofread for spelling mistakes and errors.
- Include a link to your GitHub or portfolio for extra information.
- Use a professional email address (Gmail, Outlook, or personal domain); avoid Hotmail.
- Omit objective or summary sections to save space.
- Include only "City, State" for your address.
- Name resume file as "FirstName LastName Resume".
- Email resume as a PDF, or Word doc for parsing software if needed.
- Aim for 10-second readability to make a quick impression.
- Include interests to create personal connections and stand out.
- Include numbers on as many bullet points as possible. E.g. "responsible for managing team and hosting meetings" vs. "managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"
- Bullet point format: past tense verb (created, developed, etc), number, result number.
- Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the "vague description" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this and the resume will never get looked at.
- Use an inverted pyramid style: chronological order, descending number of bullet points e.g. most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order.
- Write a strong company description under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just what that company does, if it isn't obvious.This is *KEY!*Ex: "Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America." See how much better that is than just the name?
- Spell out numbers below ten; use "+" for rounded numbers and abbreviations for thousands and millions. (ex: "157 employees ---> "150+ employees") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital "K" for thousand, "M" for million (ex: $23,800 ----> $23K+; $5 million ---> $5M)
- Limit executive summary to two sentences with numbers and strong impact.

### Interview Tips

#### General
##### Beginning
- Small talk is easy and helps build rapport.
- Avoid politics and religion.
- Discuss weather, local sports, hobbies, or compliment clothing.
- Ask open-ended questions like, "How long have you ________?" to encourage conversation.

##### Midway
- During interviews, expect questions about your current/previous role.
- Focus on problems solved, challenges faced, and your specific role.
- Avoid excessive technical details; give an overview.
- Use the STAR format to practice.
    - The STAR format is a technique used to answer behavioral interview questions by providing structured and concise responses. It stands for:

        1. Situation: Describe the context or background of the situation you faced.
        2. Task: Explain the task or objective you were responsible for.
        3. Action: Detail the specific actions you took to complete the task or address the situation.
        4. Result: Highlight the outcome or results of your actions, emphasizing any accomplishments or positive impacts.

        Using the STAR format helps you effectively communicate your experiences and skills, making it easier for interviewers to understand how you've handled challenges in the past and how you might perform in the new role.
- Earn bonus points by quantifying your business impact and revenue contributions.

##### End
- End of interview questions to gain insight into the company and position:
  1. Ask about interviewer's interest in the company.
  2. Request a summary of their experience, favorite aspects, challenges, and overall impressions.
  3. Inquire about the company culture.
  4. Find out how the position became open.
  5. Ask what success looks like for the role.
  6. Learn about the department's biggest achievements and challenges.
  7. Discover what motivates employees beyond the paycheck.

- Request a tour of the workspace to:
  1. Demonstrate confidence and interest.
  2. Meet potential colleagues.
  3. Evaluate the work environment, temperature, dress code, equipment, and atmosphere.
  4. Determine the quality of the workspace.

- Additional questions to ask:
  1. Discuss career progression opportunities.
  2. Learn what you can do now to be effective if hired.
  3. Identify the biggest problem you can help with.
  4. Ask about a typical day for the interviewer.
  5. Understand expectations for the first 30/60/90 days.
  6. Clarify operational details like work hours, remote work, vacation, compensation, retirement, and healthcare.

#### Preparation & How To Guide

1. **Setting Expectations**: Treat the interview preparation as studying for a test; invest effort in understanding foundational elements. Address knowledge gaps and don't slack off.

2. **Data Structures**: Read about, understand, and code these data structures: Array, Linked List, Stack/Queue, Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.), Heap, Hash Table (collision mitigation mechanisms, amortized constant-time), Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs, Trie, and Linked Hash Map. Know the Big-O for each operation and be able to provide real-world examples.

3. **Algorithms**: Practice coding various sorting algorithms (comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting), tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order), graph traversals (Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS), and prefix-tree searches. Understand their Big-O complexities and how they're derived. Be able to code both recursively and using your own stack/queue.

4. **Practice**: Use interview questions from various sources like Glassdoor, Cracking the Coding Interview, and other websites. Practice coding in a timed, interview-like setting. Validate your approach with an interviewer before coding.

5. **Fill Gaps**: Address any knowledge gaps in areas like coding, bit manipulation (bit shifting, big and little endian), internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, networking layers), databases (basic SQL and data modeling), testing (TDD), and operating systems (using Linux if you've only used Windows).

6. **Behavioral**: Prepare for behavioral interview questions by coming up with three positive and three negative experiences in tech projects. Practice storytelling and emphasize the impact or lessons learned. Be enthusiastic and show interest in the company.

7. **Parting Words**: Get a good night's sleep, learn from failed interviews, and treat them as learning experiences. Understand that interviewing is a game, and practice will help you succeed. Be prepared to work hard.

8. **Don't Overshare**: Be mindful of what you share during interviews and avoid over-sharing personal information or opinions that may negatively affect your chances. Maintain a professional demeanor even if you feel a connection with the interviewer.

9. **Exceptions**: It's okay to admit not knowing something, ask questions for clarification, or take a moment to compose yourself during the interview. Don't be afraid to ask for help or admit nervousness when needed.

#### Whiteboard Problem Solving Steps
1. Reiterate the problem and ensure understanding. Explain your understanding to the interviewer.

2. Think out loud and consider a brute force approach before jumping to a more optimal solution, unless it is very obvious.

3. Determine the approach your interviewer would like you to code and aim to arrive at a solution within 15 minutes.

4. Code in a modular, readable way. Avoid code duplication and use clear and descriptive names for methods and variables.

5. Test your code by running through happy path and edge cases, including null, invalid input, and loop conditions.

6. Suggest any improvements that could be made to the solution, such as throwing exceptions or logging information for debugging purposes.
