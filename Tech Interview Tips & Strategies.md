## Application Strategies
### Referrals Are Everything!
1. Create a visually appealing resume.
    - Ensure that your resume looks good, not just the content.
    - Use platforms such as LaTeX to make it visually appealing.

2. Use LinkedIn to contact people.
    - Search for the company you're interested in and look for people in Engineering or with similar backgrounds.
    - Add filters to narrow your search to your alma mater, relevant majors, or even specific connections.
    - Send connection requests and messages to 1-3 people who clear the filters.
    - Keep your message simple and straightforward, and ask for a referral.

3. Wait for a referral before applying.
    - If someone agrees to refer you, let them apply for you.
    - Applying before you are referred may disqualify you.

4. Contact recruiters if possible.
    - Recruiters can be an excellent resource for finding job opportunities.

5. Be patient.
    - This method may not work for small startups.
    - This method is more effective for full-time jobs than internships.

### Coding Interview Tips
#### Preparation & How To Guide

1. **Setting Expectations**: Treat the interview preparation as studying for a test; invest effort in understanding foundational elements. Address knowledge gaps and don't slack off.

2. **Data Structures**: Read about, understand, and code these data structures: Array, Linked List, Stack/Queue, Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.), Heap, Hash Table (collision mitigation mechanisms, amortized constant-time), Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs, Trie, and Linked Hash Map. Know the Big-O for each operation and be able to provide real-world examples.

3. **Algorithms**: Practice coding various sorting algorithms (comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting), tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order), graph traversals (Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS), and prefix-tree searches. Understand their Big-O complexities and how they're derived. Be able to code both recursively and using your own stack/queue.

4. **Practice**: Use interview questions from various sources like Glassdoor, Cracking the Coding Interview, and other websites. Practice coding in a timed, interview-like setting. Validate your approach with an interviewer before coding.

5. **Fill Gaps**: Address any knowledge gaps in areas like coding, bit manipulation (bit shifting, big and little endian), internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, networking layers), databases (basic SQL and data modeling), testing (TDD), and operating systems (using Linux if you've only used Windows).

6. **Behavioral**: Prepare for behavioral interview questions by coming up with three positive and three negative experiences in tech projects. Practice storytelling and emphasize the impact or lessons learned. Be enthusiastic and show interest in the company.

7. **Parting Words**: Get a good night's sleep, learn from failed interviews, and treat them as learning experiences. Understand that interviewing is a game, and practice will help you succeed. Be prepared to work hard.

8. **Don't Overshare**: Be mindful of what you share during interviews and avoid over-sharing personal information or opinions that may negatively affect your chances. Maintain a professional demeanor even if you feel a connection with the interviewer.

9. **Exceptions**: It's okay to admit not knowing something, ask questions for clarification, or take a moment to compose yourself during the interview. Don't be afraid to ask for help or admit nervousness when needed.

#### Whiteboard Problem Solving Steps
1. Reiterate the problem and ensure understanding. Explain your understanding to the interviewer.

2. Think out loud and consider a brute force approach before jumping to a more optimal solution, unless it is very obvious.

3. Determine the approach your interviewer would like you to code and aim to arrive at a solution within 15 minutes.

4. Code in a modular, readable way. Avoid code duplication and use clear and descriptive names for methods and variables.

5. Test your code by running through happy path and edge cases, including null, invalid input, and loop conditions.

6. Suggest any improvements that could be made to the solution, such as throwing exceptions or logging information for debugging purposes.
