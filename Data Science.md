### How to handle new projects?
- [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) as a general methodology
    1. Define the business problem.
    2. Meet with stakeholders to discuss the problem and potential solutions. This includes addressing core questions.
    3. Conduct research using SQL databases such as t-SQL, Postgres SQL, SparkSQL, Hive, etc. This may involve consulting other technical teams to better understand data or processes.
    4. Meet with stakeholders to discuss initial findings and gather feedback.
    5. Refine research and make adjustments based on stakeholder feedback.
    Document the entire process and store code on GIT for auditability.
    6. Conduct a final meeting with stakeholders to present all recommendations and obtain endorsement.
    7. Depending on the functional unit supporting the project and whether the end result is insights or changes, hand over to a manager for implementation in production.

### The Big 5 Books

1. **Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL)**: This book is a beginner-friendly introduction to statistical learning (which is essentially machine learning in a statistical context) and is written in a way that's meant to be accessible to non-mathematicians. It comes with practical examples in R. There's a free version available online.

2. **The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)**: Considered a classic in the field, this book is essentially the more advanced version of ISL. It dives deep into the mathematical foundations of machine learning. It's a valuable resource if you're comfortable with linear algebra, calculus, and probability.

3. **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**: This book is incredibly practical, focusing on teaching machine learning through hands-on examples and projects using popular Python libraries. It covers a wide range of topics, including neural networks and deep learning.

4. **Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville**: This is a comprehensive and advanced book on deep learning, written by some of the top researchers in the field. It's heavy on theory and math, so it's best for readers who already have a good understanding of the basics of machine learning.

5. **Mathematics for Machine Learning**: This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the necessary background in mathematics (including linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability) that's needed to understand machine learning algorithms. It's ideal for beginners who want to solidify their mathematical foundations.

Remember, "the best" book can vary greatly depending on a person's existing knowledge base, learning style, and what exactly they want to get out of the book. Each of these books has its own strengths and would be "the best" for different types of learners or different learning objectives. It's always a good idea to look at several resources to see which aligns best with your personal learning goals.

### Math

1. The "Mathematics for Machine Learning" book covers essentials for machine learning but assumes a firm background in probability theory, multivariate calculus, and linear algebra. 
   
2. Studying foundational mathematical topics in isolation can leave gaps in understanding their application to machine learning. This book bridges that gap, linking these topics to their machine learning applications in an in-depth way. 

3. For a person who learns by example, there is a challenge in finding resources that provide both mathematical foundations and their applications in machine learning. The problem arises from the vastness of the field of machine learning, which borrows from multiple disciplines, making it difficult for a single resource to cover all the necessary topics comprehensively.

4. Several books are recommended for different aspects of studying machine learning:

   - Basic Implementation & High-Level Understanding: "Hands on Machine Learning (2nd edition, Aurelien Geron)"
   - Math-Heavy Introduction: "Introduction to Statistical Learning (James et al.)"
   - Applied Modeling: "Applied Predictive Modeling (Kuhn and Johnson)"
   - General Introduction: "Introduction to Machine Learning (Alpaydin)"
   - Refinement: "Machine Learning Refined (Watt et al.)"
   - Deep Learning: "Deep Learning from Scratch (Weidman)"
   - Bayesian Self-Study: "Doing Bayesian Analysis (2nd edition, Kruschke)", "A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics (Lambert)", "Bayes Rule with Python (Stone)", and "Bayesian Methods for Hackers (Davidson-Pilon)"
   - Reference Books: "Machine Learning (2nd edition Theodoridis)", "Machine Learning (Murphy)", and "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms (Mackay)"
   - Linear Algebra: "Introduction to Linear Algebra (Strang)"
   - Probability Theory: "The Probability Lifesaver (Miller)", "Introduction to Probability (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis)", and "A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics (Dekking et al.)"

5. A strong understanding of linear algebra, probability, and multivariate calculus is essential to grasp the mathematical aspects of machine learning. These topics appear repeatedly in the derivations and mathematical reasoning in machine learning.
   
6. Practicing coding and not relying on pre-packaged code online or using tools like Scikit Learn will enhance understanding.

7. It's important to note that if one's goal is to understand concepts at a high level, they do not need to learn all the math. But for a deeper understanding, a solid grasp of the mathematical foundations is necessary.
