### How to handle new projects?
- [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) as a general methodology
    1. Define the business problem.
    2. Meet with stakeholders to discuss the problem and potential solutions. This includes addressing core questions.
    3. Conduct research using SQL databases such as t-SQL, Postgres SQL, SparkSQL, Hive, etc. This may involve consulting other technical teams to better understand data or processes.
    4. Meet with stakeholders to discuss initial findings and gather feedback.
    5. Refine research and make adjustments based on stakeholder feedback.
    Document the entire process and store code on GIT for auditability.
    6. Conduct a final meeting with stakeholders to present all recommendations and obtain endorsement.
    7. Depending on the functional unit supporting the project and whether the end result is insights or changes, hand over to a manager for implementation in production.
